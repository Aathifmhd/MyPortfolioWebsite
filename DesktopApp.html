                        <p>We designed this project for our university medical unit to streamline the management of student medical records and enhance operational efficiency. 
                            Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the system includes features such as secure user authentication, online appointment scheduling, medical report previews, 
                            record submissions, and inventory management for medical supplies. This centralized solution ensures secure data storage, real-time access to health records, and improved scheduling to reduce waiting times. 
                            The project highlights our expertise in full-stack development and our dedication to creating impactful solutions for real-world challenges.</p>
